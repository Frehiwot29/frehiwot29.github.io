 *  Design a hospital management system.In the system, we have doctors and patients.

 * We have 2 different types of doctors that are surgeon and physician.
 * Surgeons have doTheSurgery method, physicians have makeTheTreatment method.
 * Implement this system by using inheritance. You have to use class keyword. You can define
other objects if necessary.
