/**
 * . Write a function, scoreExams, that takes an array of arrays of student answers and an array of
the correct answers. It should compare each studentâ€™s answers against the correct answers and
return an array holding the scores of each student. The score for each student is a count of the
number of correct answers (i.e., matches with the key of correct answers). For example
const studentAnswers = [[1, 1, 2], [2, 1, 2], [3, 1, 3]];
const correctAnswers = [3, 1, 2];
scoreExams(studentAnswers, correctAnswers)); --> [2, 2, 2]
