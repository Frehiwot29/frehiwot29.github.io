      Answer the following questions in a word document based on your reading assignment

      1. What will be the output of running following code?

               console.log(Number(null));//-----> 0
               console.log(Number(undefined));//----->NaN
               console.log(Boolean("0"));//-----> true
               console.log(Boolean(" "))  //-----> true
      2. What will be the output of running following code?

               let a = b = 2;
               let c = 3 - (a + b + 1);
               console.log(a--); //-----> 2
               console.log(++c); //-----> -1
               console.log(a); //-----> 1
               console.log(c); //-----> -1
      3. What is the significance of + operator before prompt function in following code?

           let a = +prompt("First number?"); 
       Answer:  //-----> it uses to change an input string to number
    
      4. What is the use of !! and ?? operators in JavaScript? Explain with an example of each.
         ??
       The use of ?? is to get the first “defined” value of the two or it is used 
        to provide a default value for a potentially undefined variable.

         Example1:
       Let x;
       Let b=7;
      Console.log(x??b);// this gives us 7. Because if x=null or if x is undefined it gives us b, but if x is defined it gives us a.
        Example2:
         Let x=5;
        Let b=7;
       Console.log(x??b);// this gives us 5. Because x is defined and it’s value is 5; 
       Answer:
       ||

       The || is the same as ?? . but their difference is:
          || returns the first truthy value.
          ?? returns the first defined value.
      5. Which of the following statements is true?

            a. In computer programming, a statement can be part of an expression.----->False
            b. In computer programming, an expression can be a part of a statement.----->True
