 1. What are alternatives to default parameters?
 2. What are things you should consider while naming a function?
                Answer
 1. The alternateve to default parametrs are using default value as function parametrs
      example 1. 
      function name(name1){
           name1=name1 || 'no name'
      } 
      example 2.
      function name2(name='no name'){

      }
  2. The function name have to have the name which describes 
       for what we are doing(choosing word with meaning).
         -Avoiding generic names(like temp)
         - do make the name function too long or too short
